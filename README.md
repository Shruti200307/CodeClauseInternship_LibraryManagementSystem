# CodeClauseInternship_LibraryManagementSystem
Hello!! Ok so basically, I was doing this internship project for CodeClause.
They have given us several options to make a project on and we have to do one of them to earn a certificate. So, from many of the options I chose Library Management System.
I have done this project using NetBeans as it is easy to make a GUI interface in netbeans.
Also, I have used XAMPP server for making database.
This is my First project. I am just a beginner and have learnt many of the new things from this project. Hope, I'll upload many more projects soon.
